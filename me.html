       <p style="width:auto">The Aerospace and Aviation campus Kamra of Air University Islamabad was created in 2019 and offers two graduate Engineering programs, namely Aerospace engineering and Avionics engineering. In addition, the campus provides three non-engineering undergraduate programs in Business administration, Computer science, and Cybersecurity. In 2020, two engineering undergraduate programs, namely BE. Mechanical Engineering and BE. Electrical engineering, were introduced. At present, the department has a group of highly qualified and experienced faculty members who possess a notable academic background and are actively involved in research.To meet the demands of the contemporary industry, the Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering program has been designed to include theory and laboratory courses covering four key areas: Solid Mechanics and Design, Thermofluids, Manufacturing, and Dynamics & Control. Additionally, almost 30% of the courses encompass Math, Physics, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Management domains. The program is spread over eight semesters (four years) and requires completion of 136 credit hours, including theory and laboratory courses, as well as project/research work.The department of mechanical engineering has PEC level-II accreditation for the Mechanical Engineering degree program. As a result, the BEME program continues to be one of the most popular engineering programs offered by Air University. The Mechanical Engineering Master of Science program offers two specializations: Design Engineering and Fluid Power Engineering. To obtain the MS degree, students must successfully complete 25 credit hours of coursework and 6 credit hours of research work. Both MS and PhD research work is aimed at producing outcomes that meet the criteria for publication in prestigious international journals. </p>
